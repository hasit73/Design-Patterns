# Design-Patterns
Various Design patterns with easy and simple code example in Python.

Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development. These solutions were obtained by trial and error by numerous software developers over quite a substantial period of time.

### Usage:

#### 1) Common platform for developers
Design patterns provide a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenario. For example, a singleton design pattern signifies use of single object so all developers familiar with single design pattern will make use of single object and they can tell each other that program is following a singleton pattern.

#### 2) Best Practices
Design patterns have been evolved over a long period of time and they provide best solutions to certain problems faced during software development. Learning these patterns helps unexperienced developers to learn software design in an easy and faster way.

### Mainly three groups of patterns:

1) Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

2) Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

3) Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

Apart from this there are other type of patterns as well.

### Why you should use design patterns?
- Design patterns help you analyze the more abstract areas of a program by providing concrete, well-tested solutions.
- Design patterns help you write code faster by providing a clearer picture of how you are implementing the design.
- Design patterns encourage more legible and maintainable code by following well-understood paths.
- Design patterns increasingly provide a common language and jargon for programmers.
